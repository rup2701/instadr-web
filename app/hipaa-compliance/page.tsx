            <li>Risk analysis: A risk analysis is a procedure by which the entire organization is assessed for potential security
              vulnerabilities and risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
              electronic protected health information (ePHI) held by the covered entity.
              <span className="hipaa-answer">
                We believe we are our part a security co and part a healthcare co. That we are entrusted with sensitive 
                and we conduct vey aspect of our work with security as the highest priority. Staff and engineers that 
                come in contact with ePHI are given strict guidelines how a given piece of data is to be handled.

            </li>          
            <li>Risk Management (Required): Once a risk analysis has been conducted, and all potential security vulnerabilities
              identified, the covered entity must then implement security measures sufficient to
              reduce those risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level.
                <span className="hipaa-answer">
                  We have not identified any security vulnerabilities thus far. But we are constantly improviing our

                </span>
              </li>
            <li>Sanction Policy (Required): A sanction policy must be put in place to allow the covered entity to take action
              against workforce members who fail to comply with the security policies and
              procedures of the covered entity.

                When we hire people we make it crystal clear the importance of security at our workplace. We train them
                with our security processes and procedures. So we hope we don't have to sanction anyone in the future. But if
                we find anyone in breach of protocols - they will have to retake <mark>HIPAA Security and Privacy rules training</mark>, and 
                ensure <mark>processes</mark> are not skipped.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>Information System Activity Review (Required): It is essential all covered entities implement a system – preferably automated –
              that logs activity relating to ePHI; in particular any requests to access patient
              records or make amendments to ePHI. Audit logs must be created, and the system
              must be capable of generating security incident tracking reports.

          <p>Policies and procedures to ensure members of the workforce have appropriate access to ePHI, as
            required under the Information Access Management standard, while others must
            be prevented from viewing ePHI.</p>
          <h6 className="mt-4">Implementation specifications:</h6>
          <ol>
            <li>Authorization and/or Supervision (Addressable): Policies must be developed and procedures implemented which allow users to be
              granted authorization to access or amend ePHI commensurate with their position. <br />
              <span className="hipaa-answer">
                No individual/employee at InstaDR has access or can amend any ePHI due to its encrypted nature. ePHI can only
                be amended by patients using our mobile apps.</span>
            </li>
            <li>Workforce Clearance Procedure (Addressable): A clearance procedure must exist that assesses whether the level of access to ePHI
              an individual workforce member needs to perform his or her duties is appropriate.
              <span className="hipaa-answer">
                All access to ePHI is via secured programming endpoints. Database access is for administrators
                and they cannot view since the stored data is encrypted.</span>
            </li>
            <li>Termination Procedures (Addressable): Just as procedures must be developed to grant users access to essential ePHI,
              procedures must also be in place to terminate those access rights when they are no
              longer required, such as following a change in the individual’s duties or a_er the
              termination of an employment contract.

        <div>
          <h5 className="mt-4">Information Access Management</h5>
          <p>The fourth standard covers the management of access to ePHI by members of the
            workforce who need to view, amend or update ePHI as part of their daily duties.
            Controlling access is an essential element of data security that limits the potential
            for accidental or deliberate disclosure of PHI to non-authorized individuals, while
            also limiting the possibility of erasure or alteration of ePHI</p>
          <h6 className="mt-4">Implementation specifications:</h6>
          <ol>
            <li>Isolating Healthcare Clearinghouse Functions (Required):

                InstaDR does not perform any functions of a clearinghouse.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>Access Authorization (Addressable): This speci:cation is similar to that stated in the Workforce Security section, but
              instead of determining access rights, Access Authorization requires policies and
              procedures to be implemented for granting access to ePHI, such as through a
              particular workstation or for speci:c transactions, programs, processes, or other
              mechanisms.
              <span className="hipaa-answer">

              </li>
            <li>Access Establishment and Modification (Addressable): A covered entity must implement policies and procedures that, based upon the
              entity’s access authorization policies, establish, document, review, and modify a
              user’s right of access to a workstation, transaction, program, or process.

        <div>
          <h5 className="mt-4">Security Awareness and Training</h5>
          <p>One of the most important elements of the administrative safeguards is the
            provision of training on the HIPAA Security and Privacy Hules, not only for the
            staff granted access to ePHI or may otherwise come into contact with it, but all
            members of the workforce, including management.</p>
          <h6 className="mt-4">Implementation specifications:</h6>
          <ol>
            <li>Security Reminders (Addressable): The provision of training ensures the workforce is fully aware of the HIPAA
              Privacy and Security Rules; however, policies frequently need to be updated and
              these changes must be communicated to staff. It is also important to provide the
              workforce with reminders on the importance of data security, policies and
              procedures.
              <span className="hipaa-answer">
                All reminders are documented and introduced to staff members when they join the workforce.
                All security measures dealing with architecture and programming activities are also well documented. We are
                constantly evaluating and improving our security processes and implementation.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>Protection from Malicious Software (Addressable): All members of the workforce must receive training to help them identify
              potentially dangerous software and staff should be aware of how, and to whom,
              they should report the potential installation of malicious so_ware. This includes
              developing policies that restrict how the Internet is used and what can be
              downloaded.

              Procedures must be developed for monitoring log-in attempts and reporting
              discrepancies. A system must be in place that can log access attempts, such as
              multiple attempts to gain access to ePHI using incorrect passwords or usernames.

              <span className="hipaa-answer">
                ePHI cannot be accessed by any individual or employee even if they can get acesss to usernames.

              </span>
            </li>

            <li>Password Management (Addressable): Procedures must be developed to cover creating, changing, and safeguarding
            passwords used to access ePHI.</li>
            <span className="hipaa-answer">
              Rolling passwords are used and employees are advised how to safeguard passwords and scripts
